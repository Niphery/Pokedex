# Pokedex
This project was taught in "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional" by Mark Price. This was one of the bigger projects taught in Mark's course.
 It focused on parsing data from pokeapi.co using Alamofire, learning how to use collection views and proper error handling with optionals so that the application doesn't crash if something goes wrong during data parsing.

After the course, Mark tasked us with creating the "moves" section for the Pokemon.
I did this using a UISegmentedController to hide the Stack Views and show a UITableView.
The design I chose to make for the move list could have been better (as some move descriptions are rather large) however I accomplished what I wanted to do with this application.
